           <p>The following practitioners offer private sessions or group classes aimed at considering the integration of body and mind. Please contact the instructors directly for further information and registration.</p>
           
          <h2>Twin Cities Music Therapy Services, LLC</h2>
          <p>Twin Cities Music Therapy Services, LLC. is dedicated to providing the highest quality services using music to promote health through empowering children and adults of all abilities to become actively invested in their process of growth.

          <h2>Taking Root Massage Therapy</h2>
          <p>Taking Root Massage Therapy utilizes both deep tissue work (rehabilitative massage and trigger point therapy) along with relaxation massage techniques.  I have also studied Myofascial Release with John Barnes and am certified in Bodywork for the Childbearing Year, a program designed by expert pregnancy bodyworker, Kate Jordan.  Before the start of each there is an intake conversation where we discuss your goals for the session along with any physical concerns you may have.  Each session is unique and adapted to address your individual goals and concerns.  With every session it is my intention to provide support that increases your wellness, aids your healing process, and leads to growth.</p>
			
          <h2>Deep Peace Bodyworks Massage Studio</h2>
          <p>There is no “standard massage” at Deep Peace Bodyworks.  Deep Peace Bodyworks always customize your massage based on what you request, your health history, and what I find in your tissue once I get started. Some clients want a relaxing full-body massage, some want extra attention to one or several areas, and some want very focused work on particular sore muscles, knots, or old injuries. I am grateful for this variety in my practice. Deep Peace Bodyworks look forward to finding out just what sort of massage you want, and collaborating with you to provide a deeply satisfying massage experience.</p>
