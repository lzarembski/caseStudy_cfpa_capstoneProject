          <h2>Zach Dietz</h2>
          <p>Zach teaches beginning piano lessons for all ages as well as continuing studies for intermediate to advanced students.  Instruction is also available for jazz students of any level with an intermediate piano background.  He holds a degree in music from St. Cloud State University as both a trained classical pianist and jazz musician.  He studied classically with Dr. Carmen Wilhite and Dr. James Dennihan and received his jazz training from Dr. Kim Gast.  Perhaps most important is the real world experience shared through lessons with his students fostered by his own education in country, jazz, R+B, funk and all things hip courtesy his teacher and longtime Twin Cities pianist/musician John Pinckaers.

          <h2>Doug Rohde</h2>
          <p>Doug has been playing piano, Hammond organ, and keyboards in jazz, blues, rock, and show bands in the Twin Cities since 1987. Currently, he is serving as music director for Collide Theatrical Dance Company, and has also served in that capacity at Interact Center For the Visual and Performing Arts. Bands include BLU-7, a 5-piece jazz combo featuring vocalist Sarah M. Greer; The Blue Eyes Band, a big band featuring vocalists Tim Patrick and Debbie O’Keefe; and The Auto Body Experience, a 7-piece horn-driven rock band led by guitarist and composer Scott Yoho.</p> 
          <p>Private piano instruction with Doug includes ear training, composition, and improvisation, as well as classical technique, sight reading, theory, and repertoire. Doug’s classical teaching method comes from his mentor Gary Klemp, who studied at the Academy of Music in Vienna; and his improvisation method comes from time spent with Boston-based jazz great Jerry Bergonzi. He has created, with the Minnesota Music Teachers Association, a “popular styles” program for private piano teachers, with an emphasis on ear training, improvisation, and the American popular music tradition. All ages and all skill levels are welcome.</p>
